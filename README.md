- [sample charts (with goals)](https://jupyter-health.2i2c.cloud/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fjupyterhealth%2Fdemos&urlpath=voila%2Frender%2Fdemos%2Fdashboards%2Fsample-charts-with-goals.ipynb&branch=main)

Clicking a link above should take you to the Hub, clone the repo, and show you the dashboard.

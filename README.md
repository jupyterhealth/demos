# JupyterHealth demos

Demo notebooks to be run on the JupyterHealth deployment.
These notebooks are for running on our demonstration deployment, and contain code specific to our deployment.
They are publicly available for reference, but are not meant to be functional outside our own demo environment.

Here are some [nbgitpuller](https://nbgitpuller.readthedocs.io/en/latest/link.html) links to run dashboards on the Hub:

- [sample charts](https://staging.jupyter-health.2i2c.cloud/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fjupyterhealth%2Fdemos&urlpath=voila%2Frender%2Fdemos%2Fdashboards%2Fsample-charts.ipynb&branch=main)

Clicking a link above should take you to the Hub, clone the repo, and show you the dashboard.

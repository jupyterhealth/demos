# demos

demo notebooks to be run on the JupyterHealth deployment.

Here are some [nbgitpuller](https://nbgitpuller.readthedocs.io/en/latest/link.html) links to run dashboards on the Hub:

- [create deep links](https://jupyter-health.2i2c.cloud/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fjupyterhealth%2Fdemos&urlpath=voila%2Frender%2Fdemos%2Fdashboards%2Fdeeplink.ipynb&branch=main)
- [sample charts (before goal)](https://jupyter-health.2i2c.cloud/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fjupyterhealth%2Fdemos&urlpath=voila%2Frender%2Fdemos%2Fdashboards%2Fsample-charts.ipynb&branch=main)
- [sample charts (with goal)](https://jupyter-health.2i2c.cloud/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fjupyterhealth%2Fdemos&urlpath=voila%2Frender%2Fdemos%2Fdashboards%2Fsample-charts-with-goal.ipynb&branch=main)

Clicking either link should take you to the Hub, clone the repo, and show you the dashboard.
